\details{
Function \code{jointModel} fits joint models for longitudinal and survival data (more detailed information about the formulation of these
models can be found in Rizopoulos (2010)). For the longitudinal responses the linear mixed effects model represented by the \code{lmeObject} is 
assumed. For the survival times let \eqn{w_i} denote the vector of baseline covariates in \code{survObject}, with associated parameter vector 
\eqn{\gamma}, \eqn{m_i(t)} the value of the longitudinal outcome at time point \eqn{t} as approximated by the linear mixed model 
(i.e., \eqn{m_i(t)} equals the fixed-effects part \code{+} random-effects part of the linear mixed effects model for sample unit \eqn{i}), 
\eqn{\alpha} the association parameter for \eqn{m_i(t)}, \eqn{m_i'(t)} the derivative of \eqn{m_i(t)} with respect to \eqn{t}, and 
\eqn{\alpha_d} the association parameter for \eqn{m_i'(t)}. Then, for \code{method = "weibull-AFT-GH"} a time-dependent Weibull model under 
the accelerated failure time formulation is assumed. For \code{method = "weibull-PH-GH"} a time-dependent relative risk model is postulated 
with a Weibull baseline risk function. For \code{method = "piecewise-PH-GH"} a time-dependent relative risk model is postulated with a 
piecewise constant baseline risk function. For \code{method = "spline-PH-GH"} a time-dependent relative risk model is assumed in which the 
log baseline risk function is approximated using B-splines. For \code{method = "ch-Laplace"} an additive model on the log cumulative hazard 
scale is assumed (see Rizopoulos et al., 2009 for more info). Finally, for \code{method = "Cox-PH-GH"} a time-dependent relative risk model 
is assumed where the baseline risk function is left unspecified (Wulfsohn and Tsiatis, 1997). For all these options the linear predictor for the
survival submodel is written as \deqn{\eta = \gamma^\top w_i + \alpha m_i\{max(t-k, 0)\},}{eta = gamma' w_i + alpha m_i{max(t-k,0)},} when 
\code{parameterization = "value"}, \deqn{\eta = \gamma^\top w_i + \alpha_s m_i'\{max(t-k, 0)\},}{eta = gamma' w_i + alpha m_i'{max(t-k, 0)}} 
when \code{parameterization = "slope"}, and \deqn{\eta = \gamma^\top w_i + \alpha m_i\{max(t-k, 0)\} + \alpha_s m_i'\{max(t-k, 0)\},}{eta = 
gamma' w_i + alpha m_i{max(t-k, 0)} + \alpha_s m_i'{max(t-k, 0)},} when \code{parameterization = "both"}, where in all the above the value 
of \eqn{k} is specified by the \code{lag} argument and \eqn{m_i'(t) = d m_i(t) / dt}. If \code{interFact} is specified, then
\eqn{m_i\{max(t-k, 0)\}} and/or \eqn{m_i'\{max(t-k, 0)\}} are multiplied with the design matrices derived from the formulas
supplied as the first two arguments of \code{interFact}, respectively. In this case \eqn{\alpha} and/or \eqn{\alpha_s} become vectors of
association parameters.

For \code{method = "spline-PH-GH"} it is also allowed to include stratification factors. These should be included in the specification of
the \code{survObject} using function \code{strata()}. Note that in this case \code{survObject} must only be a 'coxph' object.

For all survival models except for the time-dependent proportional hazards model, the optimization algorithm starts 
with EM iterations, and if convergence is not achieved, it switches to quasi-Newton iterations (i.e., BFGS in 
\code{optim()} or \code{nlminb()}, depending on the value of the \code{optimizer} control argument). For \code{method = "Cox-PH-GH"} only the 
EM algorithm is used. During the EM iterations, convergence is declared if either of the following two conditions is satisfied: (i) 
\eqn{ L(\theta^{it}) - L(\theta^{it - 1}) < tol_3 \{ | L(\theta^{it - 1}) | + tol_3 \} }, or (ii) 
\eqn{ \max \{ | \theta^{it} - \theta^{it - 1} | / ( | \theta^{it - 1} | + tol_1) \} < tol_2}, where \eqn{\theta^{it}} and 
\eqn{\theta^{it - 1}} is the vector of parameter values at the current and previous iterations, respectively, and \eqn{L(.)} is the 
log-likelihood function. The values for \eqn{tol_1}, \eqn{tol_2} and \eqn{tol_3} are specified via the \code{control} argument. During the 
quasi-Newton iterations, the default convergence criteria of either \code{optim()} or \code{nlminb()} are used.

The required integrals are approximated using the standard Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule when the chosen option for the \code{method}
argument contains the string "GH", and the (pseudo) adaptive Gauss-Hermite rule when the chosen option for the \code{method}
argument contains the string "aGH". For \code{method = "ch-Laplace"} the fully exponential Laplace approximation described in 
Rizopoulos et al. (2009) is used.  The (pseudo) adaptive Gauss-Hermite and the Laplace approximation are particularly useful when 
high-dimensional random effects vectors are considered (e.g., when modelling nonlinear subject-specific trajectories with splines 
or high-order polynomials).

\note{
1. The \code{lmeObject} argument should represent a linear mixed model object with a simple random-effects 
structure, i.e., only the \code{pdDiag()} class is currently allowed.

2. The \code{lmeObject} object should not contain any within-group correlation structure (i.e., \code{correlation} 
argument of \code{lme()}) or within-group heteroscedasticity structure (i.e., \code{weights} argument of \code{lme()}).

3. It is assumed that the linear mixed effects model \code{lmeObject} and the survival model \code{survObject} have been 
fitted to the same subjects. Moreover, it is assumed that the ordering of the subjects is the same for both 
\code{lmeObject} and \code{survObject}, i.e., that the first line in the data frame containing the event times 
corresponds to the first set of lines identified by the grouping variable in the data frame containing the repeated 
measurements, and so on.

4. In the \code{print} and \code{summary} generic functions for class \code{jointModel}, the estimated coefficients (and
standard errors for the \code{summary} generic) for the event process are augmented with the element "Assoct" that 
corresponds to the association parameter \eqn{\alpha} and the element "Assoct.s" that corresponds to the parameter 
\eqn{\alpha_s} when \code{parameterization} is \code{"slope"} or \code{"both"} (see \bold{Details}).

5. The standard errors returned by the \code{summary} generic function for class \code{jointModel} when 
\code{method = "Cox-PH-GH"} are based on the profile score vector (i.e., given the NPMLE for the unspecified baseline 
hazard). Hsieh et al. (2006) have noted that these standard errors are underestimated.

6. As it is the case for all types of mixed models that require numerical integration, it is advisable (especially in
difficult datasets) to check the stability of the maximum likelihood estimates with an increasing number of 
Gauss-Hermite quadrature points.

7. It is assumed that the scale of the time variable (e.g., days, months years) is the same in both \code{lmeObject} and \code{survObject}.
